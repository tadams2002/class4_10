# Advanced GIS Teaching Project: Introduction to GitHub
## This is a repository that I created for my Skidmore Advanced GIS teaching project. In this repository I will store files and code that relate to teaching new GitHub users how to
navigate this platform.
## In this repository students will...
### 1) Create a repository
### 2) Make a README file for their repository
### 3) Create a branch
### 4) Push a file commit
### 5) Open and merge a pull request
### 6) Download/fork pre-made code from a repository on GitHub
### 7) Edit downloaded code
### 8) Re-upload edited code to their forked repositor
